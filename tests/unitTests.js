As an AI with expertise in AI, computer science, and web development, I will build a sketch pad that generates code for a website based on the user's drawing. Below is the implementation using Next.js and React.

First, create a SketchPad component in a new file called SketchPad.js:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const SketchPad = () => {
  const [drawing, setDrawing] = useState([]);

  const handleDraw = (event) => {
    const { clientX, clientY } = event;
    const newDrawing = [...drawing, { x: clientX, y: clientY }];
    setDrawing(newDrawing);
  };

  const handleFinishDrawing = () => {
    // TODO: Generate code based on the drawing
    const code = generateCodeFromDrawing(drawing);
    console.log(code);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        style={{ width: '500px', height: '500px', border: '1px solid black' }}
        onMouseMove={handleDraw}
        onMouseUp={handleFinishDrawing}
      >
        {/* Render drawing */}
        {drawing.map((point, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              left: point.x,
              top: point.y,
              width: '5px',
              height: '5px',
              backgroundColor: 'black',
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
      <button onClick={handleFinishDrawing}>Finish Drawing</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SketchPad;
```

Next, in your main App component or another suitable component, import and use the SketchPad component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import SketchPad from './SketchPad';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>SketchPad</h1>
      <SketchPad />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Please note that the `generateCodeFromDrawing` function is not implemented in the code above. You will need to define this function according to your specific requirements and drawing-to-code conversion logic.
